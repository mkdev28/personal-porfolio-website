                <p>Hello folks! This is Mohit Kankaria. Medium Sized Human. Like to work on real world applications that can have some impact. My approach to learning is Learn on the Go!
                I think now that's enough for an introduction.</p>

                        <p>
                            During this time, I was mostly chilling in school always being curious up about who's gonna happen if I put this thing to fire. I liked playing cricket , football do vast amounts of nonsense with friends. Only thing that mattered to me was who's gonna score in the next match.

                        <p>During this time , sadly i still in school . Yeah but there was a silver-lining , since i got to know there are other things that are hotter than fire. Yeah talking about my school crush . I mean yeah she was . Okay jokes aside , This was the time I started gaining interest in programming . Our school taught java as a programming language and I was like okay this is cool. I started learning more about programming and stuff . I also started learning web development on the side. This was the time I realised that I want to do something in the field of computers .

                            After school , I slogged a lot to get through all the competetive exams , boards exams. Sacrificing my social life , I somehow made my way into DJSCE .

Learned hoow to communicate with clients , understand their requirements and deliver the needs . Apart from this I also started my web development journey . Learnt HTML , CSS , JS , ReactJS , NodeJS , ExpressJS , MongoDB . Did some projects on the side . Currently working as a Web Development Mentee at DJS Compute where I am learning a lot of new things and working on real world projects.
